# Student Performance Analysis & Prediction (ML)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data and applies basic machine learning techniques to predict academic outcomes.  
The objective is to identify key factors influencing student performance and build a predictive model based on these factors.

## Key Analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between student details and academic performance.
- Analyzed factors such as study time, previous scores, and other academic indicators.
- Built a machine learning model to predict student performance using selected features.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning and preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization
- Scikit-learn – machine learning model building and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Files in Repository
- student_performance_analysis.ipynb – data analysis and machine learning implementation
- Students Performance Dataset.csv – dataset used for analysis
- README.md – project documentation

## Insights
This project demonstrates how data analysis and basic machine learning techniques can be used to uncover patterns in student performance and support data-driven academic decision-making.
